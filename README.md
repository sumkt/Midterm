This is Charmaine Sum's Midterm for Tuesday, 8/1

Online Journal:

For this midterm assignment, I wanted to create a new cards that would be automatically updated with the latest news. I also wanted to mash it up with some interesting images. 

We are often exposed to a lot of news update but they're often appearing within the crowded media environment. It is often hard for us to find interesting ones and to keep updated with just the latest updates. The visual inspiration behind these are flash card people often use that highlight key points. 

I also wanted to pair this up with interesting images that are unexpected. We often see the same images match up with the latest news and I thought adding a random mash up would make this more unexpected and interesting. I also wanted the images to be more dynamic where the user can click through the images easily and change them to whatever they think would match this news update. 

The two APIs that are used in this projects are The Guardian for the news article and Pixabay for the images. The overall project is really successful because I managed to make the 2 APIs work well together. The function of the app also works. 

The main issue I had with this project was that originally, I wanted to use the pinterest API for my images to add a more viral and social element to the image shuffle. However, I ran into a lot of issues with the Pinterest API because they only allow access to the back end dev. Therefore, I decided to use Pixabay because I thought their API was a lot more open and have a wide range of high quality digital inages. I really wanted to focus on the overall function and the flow of the app instead of getting fixated on the image source. 

I was overall happy with the final outcome. I think the image cards and news work really well together and it achieved my original goals.
